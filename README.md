- 👋 Hi, I’m @sarahinthepark
- 👀 I’m interested in digital humanities datasets, in using research to change and challenge the stories of minoritised theatre and music practitioners. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to share the flat datasets I have created into usable ways for other researchers to use and work with.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on historical research and consulting, using archives and newspaper collections
- 📫 How to reach me - use @sarahinthepark on twitter to get in touch.
